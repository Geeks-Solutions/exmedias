  # When using dind service we need to instruct docker, to talk with the
  # daemon started inside of the service. The daemon is available with
  # a network connection instead of the default /var/run/docker.sock socket.

  # The 'docker' hostname is the alias of the service container as described at

  # Note that if you're using Kubernetes executor, the variable should be set to
  # tcp://localhost:2375 because of how Kubernetes executor connects services
  # to the job container
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375/
  # When using dind, it's wise to use the overlayfs driver for
  # improved performance.
